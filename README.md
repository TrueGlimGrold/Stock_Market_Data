# Overview

Naturally money is one of the greatest things to have in this world. That is why when I set out to learn data analysis I started by analizing patterns in the stock market. I think that this is one of the harder things I could have done as a first project, as the data I had did not relate to individual stocks but rater patterns in stocks.

# Data Analysis Results

The three things that I have been testing are:
* Sucess rates according to stock categories. (top 1%, top 10% etc.)
  * I found that most of the stock values acted as anticipated. But the top 1% average and median values seemed much to high to be realistic. I don't trust the results and think the test needs to be done over. 


* Highest values of individual stocks.
  * Some of the highest values were significantly higher than the rest of the values. I think that this may have had an effect on the results in the above test.


* The average result of an increase or decrease streak over the course of a year. 
  * The most interesting thing about this test was that the most sucessful categories were those that decreased the most in a row, at 8, 9, 10, and 11 decreases. Whereas stocks that increased more over time, like 5 and 6 increases tended to do worse in a years time. 

# Development Environment


I used python through visual studio code, and the pandas module. 
I also used the progres bar using pip install progressbar2

# Future Work

* I think in the future I would like to take more courses on data analysis and start from the beggining. With no previous experince this is a challenging feild. 

* I do not want to do data analysis for myself, but It might be an interesting career path. I would like to look into future opportunities in data analysis before I decide to continue.
